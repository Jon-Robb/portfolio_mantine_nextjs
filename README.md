## Jonathan Robinson's Portfolio



<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->


This portfolio was a good opportunity to learn a react library and try a framework I hadn't used before. I chose to use Mantine, a react library that provides a variety of components and hooks. I also used Next.js, a framework that provides a variety of features, including routing, server-side rendering, and static site generation. I also used MongoDB to store user data and SendGrid to handle email verification.

Utilizing Next.js as the foundational framework, I've integrated the Mantine library. While I employed version 6 of Mantine in the initial stages of this portfolio, I'm aware that version 7 has been released. The transition to v7 might be considered in future iterations, given its advancements.

For the email verification logic, MongoDB plays a pivotal role, allowing the system to store either verified emails or those pending token verification. The addition of SendGrid facilitates the email handling process, ensuring emails are dispatched and received efficiently.

The portfolio's routing is currently based on Next's page-based structure, although I've contemplated transitioning to the app router approach for enhanced navigational efficiency.
